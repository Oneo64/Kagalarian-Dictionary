	<p>This is the official Kagalarian dictionary made by the creator! Kagalarian was the first conlang ever made by Neo. In fact, it started out as a relex. But after being called out that it wasn't a real conlang, Kagalarian has been remade.</p>
	<p>Kagalarian was made for the worldbuilding project Empires of the Cosmos, where residents and citizens of the Kagalarian Empire speak it.</p>
