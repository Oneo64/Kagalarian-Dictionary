This is the official Kagalarian dictionary made by me! Kagalarian was the first conlang I ever made. In fact, it started out as a relex. But after being called out that it wasn't a real conlang, Kagalarian has been remade.

Kagalarian was made for an unnamed world (called Fantasy in Kagalarian Space for now), where residents and citizens of the Empire of Kagalar speak it.
