This is the official Kagalarian dictionary made by me! Kagalarian was the first conlang I ever made. In fact, it started out as a relex. But after being called out that it wasn't a real conlang, Kagalarian has been remade.

Kagalarian was created for a currently unnamed world (for convenience, I've referred to it as "Fantasy in Kagalarian Space" for now). It is the main language of the Kagalarian Empire and its territories.

Kagalarian was originally a constructed language that drew inspiration from the Norwegian language. However, it has become more of a Slavic language over time (as seen in the use of Cyrillic as the official script), and has taken other linguistic "feels", such as from Classical Latin and Hebrew.
